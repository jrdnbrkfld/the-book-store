# The Book Store

Users of this website are able to view a list of books using the Google Books API URL:
https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=HTML5

Each book in the list displays the book cover, title, all authors, number of pages & description.

The last 2 books in the array are injected into a seperate 'Featured' section.

The description of the books are limited to 140 characters.

I was unable to complete certain aspects of the test regarding the 'is-selected' class due to my lack of experience, but I have thoroughly enjoyed working with JavaScript and I intent to return to this project to complete this section. Apologies for not completing this part of the test.

I have made the website fully responsive when viewed on screen sizes less than/greater than 700px wide.
